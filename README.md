# CS3110-Final-Project
For my final project in this functional programming course, I worked with a two other students to create a scheduler tool for Cornell students. The application allows students to pick which courses they will take each semester of their college career, put in their grades, and save and reload the schedules. The tool also allows the schedule to be exported to an HTML file for easy viewing and tells students in the computer science department which requirements they are missing. Cornell students have access to an online scheduling tool each semester to help plan their courses for the upcoming semester. This application also allows the user to import the semester schedules from Cornell's scheduler.
